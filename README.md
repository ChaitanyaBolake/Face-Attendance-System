# Face Recognition-Based Attendance Monitoring System 📸

A contactless, automated attendance system that uses facial recognition technology to track student or employee attendance in real-time. Built with Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter.

## 📝 Abstract
This project automates the traditional attendance process by capturing real-time images via a webcam, detecting faces, and comparing them with a pre-stored database. It eliminates manual errors and proxy attendance while providing a user-friendly GUI for management.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Face Detection:** Uses OpenCV and Haarcascade Classifiers.
- **High-Accuracy Recognition:** Utilizes the `face_recognition` library (dlib-based) for precise matching.
- **Automated Logging:** Saves attendance with exact timestamps to a CSV file.
- **GUI Dashboard:** Tkinter-based interface to register new users and view records.
- **Data Management:** Uses Pandas for efficient data handling and CSV for portable storage.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **OpenCV (`cv2`):** For video capture and image processing.
- **face_recognition:** For generating face encodings and comparisons.
- **Haarcascade Classifier:** For initial face detection within the frame.
- **NumPy:** For handling image arrays and mathematical operations.
- **Pandas:** For organizing and reading attendance logs.
- **CSV Module:** For storing attendance records.
- **OS & Datetime:** For file management and timestamping.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. System Prerequisites
* **Python:** Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed.
* **C++ Build Tools (Windows Users):**
    The `dlib` library requires C++ compilers. If you face errors installing `dlib`, download the [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and select **"Desktop development with C++"** during installation.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ChaitanyaBolake/face-attendance-system.git](https://github.com/ChaitanyaBolake/face-attendance-system.git)
cd face-attendance-system
```

## 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It is best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
## 4. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries step-by-step to avoid compilation errors.


Step 1: Install dlib Note: This may take a few minutes to compile.
```bash
pip install dlib
```
Step 2: Install Project Requirements
```bash
pip install OpenCV-python 
pip install face_recognition
pip intall Numpy
pip install Pandas
pip install Datetime
```
## 5. Setup Project Files
Ensure you have the necessary Haarcascade file in your project directory.

Download haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml from the OpenCV GitHub and place it in the root folder.

Create a folder named Images (to save student photos) and Attendance (to save CSV logs) if they don't exist.

## 6. Run the Application
Start the system by running the main Python script:
```bash
python main.py
```
## 📖 How to Use

Register a New Student:
1) Enter the ID and Name in the GUI.
2) Click "Take Images" to capture the face samples.
3) Click "Save Profile" to store the encoding.

Take Attendance:
1) Click "Track Attendance".
2) The webcam will open; simply look at the camera.
3)Attendance is marked instantly when a match is found.

View Records:
Open the generated CSV file in the Attendance folder or view via the GUI table.

## 🔮 Future Scope
Integration with a cloud-based database (Firebase/SQL).
Mobile application support using Flutter.
Liveness detection to prevent spoofing with photos.
